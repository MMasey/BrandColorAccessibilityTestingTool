# APCA & Code Exports

## Description

Add APCA (Accessible Perceptual Contrast Algorithm) support and code export functionality for integrating accessible color palettes into projects.

This is Phase 2 of the roadmap - extends the core contrast checker with the newer APCA algorithm and developer-friendly export formats.
