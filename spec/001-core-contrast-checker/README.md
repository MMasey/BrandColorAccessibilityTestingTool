# Core Contrast Checker

## Description

Build a web-based tool that validates brand color palettes against WCAG 2.1 accessibility standards. Users enter colors and see a contrast grid showing all foreground/background combinations with pass/fail indicators.

This is Phase 1 of the Brand Color Accessibility Tool roadmap - the foundational functionality that all other phases build upon.
